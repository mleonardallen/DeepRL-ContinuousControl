    "For [Project 1: Navigation](https://github.com/mleonardallen/nd893-p1-navigation), I leveraged the [DQN Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602).\n",
    "\n",
    "> We present the first deep learning model to successfully learn control policies directly from high-dimensional sensory input using reinforcement learning. The model is a convolutional neural network, trained with a variant of Q-learning, whose input is raw pixels and whose output is a value function estimating future rewards. We apply our method to seven Atari 2600 games from the Arcade Learning Environment, with no adjustment of the architecture or learning algorithm. We find that it outperforms all previous approaches on six of the games and surpasses a human expert on three of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "DQN is a value based approach, seeking the optimal `action-value` function.  Performing an action with value based approaches involves an `argmax` operation to find the action with the highest value.  However, the `Reacher` environment has a `continuous action space`, and value based approaches are not suited to continuous action spaces because of this argmax operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could potentially discretize the action space, but I don't think this will be effective.  Each action is a vector with four numbers, corresponding to torque applicable to two joints. Every entry in the action vector must be a number between -1 and 1.  Even with a small amount of granularity in torque values produces a large number of possible actions.\n",

    "\n",
    "Because of the limitations of values based methods for continues action spaces, I think we need to use a policy based approach for the Reacher environment.  Policy based approaches seek to estimate the optimal policy directly, and therefore we don't run into this argmax issue that we have with value based approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, I'm going to keep it very simple using the [REINFORCE Algorithm](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.129.8871).  REINFORCE shows us how to adjust parameters so that good actions are more probable and bad actions are less probable.  Likely, this algorithm will do poorly with this environment, but we can see the results and add improvements as we go. The REINFORCE algorithm is summarized below.\n",

    "### 9. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)\n",
    "\n",
    "The updates to REINFORCE improved learning, but the agent is still taking a long time to learn the environment.  Recall one issue with REINFORCE is the update process is very inefficient! We run the policy once, update once, and then throw away the trajectory.\n",
    "\n",
    "To tackle this issue, I impliment the [PPO algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347).\n",
    "\n",
    "> We propose a new family of policy gradient methods for reinforcement learning, which alternate between sampling data through interaction with the environment, and optimizing a \"surrogate\" objective function using stochastic gradient ascent. Whereas standard policy gradient methods perform one gradient update per data sample, we propose a novel objective function that enables multiple epochs of minibatch updates. The new methods, which we call proximal policy optimization (PPO), have some of the benefits of trust region policy optimization (TRPO), but they are much simpler to implement, more general, and have better sample complexity (empirically). Our experiments test PPO on a collection of benchmark tasks, including simulated robotic locomotion and Atari game playing, and we show that PPO outperforms other online policy gradient methods, and overall strikes a favorable balance between sample complexity, simplicity, and wall-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The PPO algorithm is summarized below.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, collect some trajectories based on some policy $\\pi_{\\theta}$, and initialize theta prime $\\theta'=\\theta$\n",
    "2. Next, compute the gradient of the clipped surrogate function using the trajectories\n",
    "3. Update $\\theta'$ using gradient ascent $\\theta'\\leftarrow\\theta' +\\alpha \\nabla_{\\theta'}L_{\\rm sur}^{\\rm clip}(\\theta', \\theta)$\n",
    "4. Then we repeat step 2-3 without generating new trajectories. Typically, step 2-3 are only repeated a few times\n",
    "5. Set $\\theta=\\theta'$, go back to step 1, repeat.\n",
    "\n",
    "The clipped surrogate function is given by\n",
    "$\\frac{1}{T}\\sum^T_t \\min\\left\\{R_{t}^{\\rm future}\\frac{\\pi_{\\theta'}(a_t|s_t)}{\\pi_{\\theta}(a_t|s_t)},R_{t}^{\\rm future}{\\rm clip}_{\\epsilon}\\!\\left(\\frac{\\pi_{\\theta'}(a_t|s_t)}{\\pi_{\\theta}(a_t|s_t)}\\right)\\right\\}$"
